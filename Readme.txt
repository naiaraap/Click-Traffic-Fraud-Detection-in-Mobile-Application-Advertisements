Project available on the kaggle platform suggested as part of the course BigData Analystics with R and Microsoft Azure course from Data Science Academy (DSA). The course is part of the data scientist training, developed by DSA.

DESCRIPTION: Fraud risk is everywhere, but for companies that advertise online, click fraud can happen at an overwhelming volume, resulting in misleading click data and wasted money. Ad channels can drive up costs by simply clicking on the ad at a large scale. China is the largest mobile market in the world and therefore suffers from huge volumes of fradulent traffic. TalkingData, Chinaâ€™s largest independent big data service platform, covers over 70% of active mobile devices nationwide. They've built an IP blacklist and device blacklist. In this project, I am supose to build an algorithm that predicts whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app ad.

All datasets are available on kaggle. Link for download: https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection/data.

The scripts were developed in R language in Rstudio and must be executed in the following sequence:FraudDetDataMunging.R, FraudDetFeatureSelection.R and FraudDetModel.R.
The folder "Graphs" contains all graphs generated during execution scrips.
The file FraudDetection.pdf contains documented code and the outputs, like tables and graphs.

Operational System: Linux, Ubuntu v.18.04.1
CPU Capacity: 3100MHz
